# 🚦 Traffic Light Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **traffic light classification** using machine learning techniques. The model is trained to recognize different traffic light states (Red, Yellow, Green) and classify them accordingly. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, inference, and a real-time interface.

## ✨ Features
- 📷 **Image Processing**: Prepares traffic light images for classification.
- 🎯 **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a neural network to classify traffic light states.
- 📊 **Model Training & Validation**: Evaluates accuracy and optimizes performance.
- 🔍 **Real-time Inference**: Predicts traffic light status from input images.
- ⚡ **Live Data Training**: Model trained on real-time data.
- 🌐 **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**: Programming language.
- 📦 **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for model training.
- 🖼 **OpenCV**: Image processing and augmentation.
- 📊 **NumPy & Pandas**: Data handling and analysis.
- 🔥 **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment.
- 🌐 **Streamlit**: Web-based UI for model interaction.

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
